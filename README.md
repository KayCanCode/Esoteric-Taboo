Just a programming girl, in an IT world

Greetings and Salutations!

I figured if I was starting my journey, i'd kick it off with a B A N G!
I'm 29, an Alabama native and an avid lover of all things relatied to 
sunhine and water. I have a blended background ranging from teaching to 
management. Now i'm diving into turning my hobby into a profession 
as a programmer! Join me on this journey!
